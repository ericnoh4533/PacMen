You execute index.html to see how it works.
You will have two buttons at the begining. One is "Add PacMan" and the other is "Start Game". You can add a Pacman each time you click "Add PacMan" button. Then, you click "Start Game" button. You will see the Pacmen moving round with bouncing at the border.
Each time you click the "Start Game" the moving speed of Pacmen will be faster.
